# reddit_meme_scraper

This takes the top posts from your chosen subreddits and puts it into a pdf that's printable into a booklet so you browse memes the way our ancestors did back in caveman times.

Use `best_memes_to_pdf.py` to turn the memes into pdf. This is something I cobbled together in a few hours, so it really isn't so clean. Change the list of subreddits in that file. Also thanks to gemini and gpt for a bunch of the code.

To print, you need to install [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/downloadafter). It's only tested for windows right now, if you get it working on some other platform, please send the code my way!
